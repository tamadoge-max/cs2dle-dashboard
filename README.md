# CS2DLE Dashboard

A modern dashboard application with email-based authentication using NextAuth.js.

## Features

- **Email-based Authentication**: Users can sign up and sign in using email verification codes
- **Modern UI**: Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Theme Support**: Dark and light mode with system preference detection
- **Protected Routes**: Dashboard routes are protected with authentication middleware
- **MongoDB Integration**: User data and verification codes stored in MongoDB
- **Toast Notifications**: Beautiful toast notifications for user feedback

## Authentication Flow

### Sign Up Process
1. User enters email and username on the sign-up tab
2. System sends a 6-digit verification code to the user's email
3. User enters the verification code
4. Account is created with 'Inactive' status (requires administrator approval)
5. User cannot sign in until account is activated by an administrator

### Sign In Process
1. User enters email on the sign-in tab
2. System sends a 6-digit verification code to the user's email
3. User enters the verification code
4. NextAuth validates the code and checks if account is active
5. If account is active, a session is created and user is redirected to the dashboard
6. If account is inactive, user receives an error message

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```env
# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# SMTP (for sending verification codes)
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_email
SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
```

## API Routes

- `POST /api/auth/send-code` - Send verification code to email
- `POST /api/auth/verify-code` - Verify code and create user (signup) or validate (signin)
- `GET/POST /api/auth/[...nextauth]` - NextAuth.js authentication endpoints

## Pages

- `/` - Redirects to `/signin` if not authenticated, `/dashboard` if authenticated
- `/signin` - Authentication page with sign-in and sign-up tabs
- `/dashboard` - Protected dashboard page (requires authentication)
- `/test-toast` - Test page for toast notifications

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Database Collections

The application uses the following MongoDB collections:

- `admins` - User accounts with fields: name, email, status, role
- `verificationCodes` - Temporary verification codes with fields: email, code, type, expiresAt, createdAt

## Security Features

- Verification codes expire after 10 minutes
- Codes are deleted after successful use
- Protected routes with NextAuth middleware
- Server-side session validation
- Input validation with Zod schemas
